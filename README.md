# Design-and-Implement-a-Secure-Internal-Network
Design and Implement a Secure Internal Network that will support both productivity and protection of internal services.

## Case Study Overview
Catnork Technologies Ltd. is a rapidly growing tech company that has recently moved into a new office space. As part of the IT department's mandate, they are expected to design and implement a secure internal network that will support both productivity and protection of internal services.
The company's network includes a central router, two switches, desktop PCs, a laptop used by an engineer, and critical servers such as a DHCP server, DNS server, and a webserver hosting the internal company site. Devices are grouped across departments and connected through different switches, with all traffic routed through a central router.

## Aim of the Project
As the network security administrator, My responsibility is to design and implement a functional network for Catnork Technologies, following the structure described in the case study.
After building the network with all necessary devices and services, I will configure an Extended Access Control List (ACL) on the router to ensure that only the engineering laptop can access the webserver via HTTP..
All other devices must be restricted from HTTP access to the webserver, while still maintaining access to other essential network services. The ACL must be applied correctly and in line with the direction of network traffic flow.

## Objective of the Project
Design and build a functioning organizational network using a router, switches, PCs, and servers in Packet Tracer Implement DHCP and static addressing as needed
Understand and apply Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict HTTP access
Allow only one laptop to access the internal webserver while blocking all others from doing so
Ensure that other services like DHCP, DNS, and general connectivity remain functional
Demonstrate an understanding of where and how to apply ACLs in a routed network
